# Java-Quest
Get ready to discover a vast world filled with rich possibility to explore.
With loads of easter eggs, multiplayer and fun monsters, you will surely find a laugh.
Many things in this game are "unlockable", such as:
* viewing the game in "colors" 
* having free movement 
* seeing the hp gauge of an enemy and your damage amount
* changing your name

But I won't tell you all the things you can get, you will have to discover them yourself ;)
Have fun!
